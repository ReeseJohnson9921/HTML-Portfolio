<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>
  Hi, my name is Reese and I am currently 20 years old. I grew up in
 Nebraska, which whenever I tell someone that they usually have no clue
 where it is! But that's okay! Because, there's not a lot in Nebraska!

  I moved to Idaho about 3 or 4 years ago and attended Ririe Senior High, 
  it's a small school and my graduating class wasn't that big compared
  to other schools. But I did like having a smaller class because you got
  to know everyone really well. When I graduated High School, I attended
  Idaho State University for a year before realizing that college just 
  isn't for me!
